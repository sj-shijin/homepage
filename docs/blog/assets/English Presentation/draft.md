## Cyber Security

Hello everyone, the topic of this report is about Cyber Security.

## About Me

Firstly, let me introduce myself. My name is Shi Jin, from the Institute of Information Engineering. My major is Cyber Security, and my current research direction is High Performance Computing and Programming.

## What is Cyber Security?

Next, let me show the definition of Cyber Security. In short, Cyber Security is about protecting everything in cyberspace, including applications, information, networks, and so on, to prevent them from being attacked.

## Cyber Security is Close to us

You may feel that Cyber Security is far away from you, but in fact, every time we open a website or connect to WiFi, there are corresponding network security protocols to protect your private information.

## Cryptography

Cryptography is an important part of Cyber Security, providing underlying mathematical support for complex security protection.

## Imagine the Simplest Case

Let's imagine the simplest Case. Alice and Bob are sending messages to each other through the network. Then another person, Eve, appears. She uses some methods to intercept the message sent by Alice. She pretends to be Alice to send the message to Bob, and gets Bob's reply. Finally, she pretends to be Bob to reply to Alice.

In this case, Alice and Bob believe that their conversation is problem-free, but Eve has already gotten the content of their dialogue.

## Encrypt using a key!

It isn't what we want to see, so cryptographers came up with the idea of encrypting the information. Alice and Bob share a pair of keys. Before sending the message, Alice encrypts it then sends the ciphertext to Bob. When Bob receives the ciphertext, he can use his key to decrypt it and get the message.

After doing this, even if Eve intercepts the ciphertext, she can't decrypt it without the matching key.

## Why is High Performance Computing needed?

The last question is about my research direction, why do we need high performance computing? To ensure the security of cipher, the process of encryption and decryption is usually a complex function. For users, they can encrypt and decrypt faster, and make the communication process smoother. For cryptanalysts, high performance computing can help them analyze or crack cipher faster.
